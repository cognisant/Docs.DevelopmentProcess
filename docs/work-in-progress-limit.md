# Origin of the Work in Progress Limit

Often at the end of a sprint, the team would have produced a solution for all of the stories on the scrum board. However, the code would have either not been reviewed, or the issues identified in the review were yet to be addressed.  
The work was not done.

At a retrospective meeting, the team decided that the team should only be able to work on a number of stories at once (currently 3).  
We do not start working on a new story until one of the in-progress stories is done.

In practice, this encourages members of the team to review code as soon as it is completed.  
It often leads to pair-programming on stories, or 'parallelising' work on larger stories (at least two team members working on different tasks simultaneously).

The work in progress limit has ensured that there are few, if any, half-finished stories at the end of a sprint.  
It also encourages collaboration and has increased our productivity.
