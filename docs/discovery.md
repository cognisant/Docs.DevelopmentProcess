# Discovery

Bath ASU employees can add cards to the Software Development Trello board using a custom form, hosted internally on the Intranet. This form asks users to explain the problem they are facing, what impact this has on the business, and (optionally) what solution they have in mind to solve the problem.

When someone submits information using this form, a card is created in the Inbox list on the Software Development Trello board. The card is automatically formatted using a pre-defined template:

```
# Original Description

Requested by [name] ([email])

> **Title**
>
> [title]
>
> **Description**
>
> [description]
>
> **Solution**
>
> [solution]
>
> **Business Impact**
>
> [business impact]
```

Occasionally, the software development team will manually add cards to Trello at the request of Bath ASU management. When this happens, cards should follow the same format as above.

## Moving on from Ideas

Cards are normally added to the Software Development Trello board as ideas. These ideas get researched and turned into fully-specified _stories_ or _bugs_. Both story cards and bug cards use a consistent structure to help people understand the requirements and the genesis of the value being proposed.

Fully-specified stories and bugs should clearly explain what problem is being solved, how it should be solved, and what the impact of that solution is on the business.

Stories look like:

> # Story
>
> As a [role], I want [thing], so that [reason].
>
> # Acceptance Criteria
>
> -
>
> ---
>
> # Original description
>
> ... (as above)

Bugs look like:

> # How to Reproduce
>
> ...
>
> # Expected Behaviour
>
> ...
>
> # Actual Behaviour
>
> ...
>
> # Impact
>
> ...
