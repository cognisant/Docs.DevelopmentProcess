# Daily Scrum Agenda

The daily scrum is a quick meeting to update the team’s shared understanding of the sprint’s progress. It is not for discussing tasks or technical detail.

In turn, each present team member answers the following questions:

- What they you done since the last scrum?
- Is anything blocking you from making progress?

The team will then discuss and allocate work to be completed by the next daily scrum.

If applicable, this is also an appropriate time to share any news that affects the whole team.
