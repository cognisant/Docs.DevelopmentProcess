# Scrum Agenda

The daily scrum is a quick meeting to update the team’s shared understanding of the sprint’s progress. It is not for discussing tasks or technical detail.

In turn, each present team member shares:

- What I have done since the last scrum.
- What I will do next.
- Things that are blocking me.
- Any ongoing distractions.
- Any upcoming planned absences.
- Any news that directly affects the whole team.
