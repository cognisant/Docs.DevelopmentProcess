# Backlog Refinement Agenda

The overall goal of backlog refinement sessions is to leave idea backlogs, product backlogs and technical improvement backlogs in a tidier, better-defined state.

There is no fixed agenda for backlog refinement sessions. However, the team should begin the session by reviewing the following list of tasks that may need doing. The team should aim for a balance of these tasks to ensure nothing gets overlooked or left behind.

## Tasks

### On product boards

- Triage any items in the Inbox.
- Check the order of ideas in the Idea Backlog.
- Identify ideas that need to researching and specifying. Either allocate these to individuals on Trello or specify in the backlog refinement session.
- Triage any cards in the Researching Solution list.
- Check the order of stories in the Product Backlog.
- Estimate any stories that are fully specified.

### On the Technical Improvements board

- Triage any items in the Inbox.
- Review On Hold items.
- Split epics into tasks.
- Estimate tasks that are fully specified.
- Move finished epics to the Done list.
