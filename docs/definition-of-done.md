# Definition of Done

It is essential to have a well defined ‘definition of done’ so that we know when we should call a story complete. This effectively forms an implicit set of acceptance criteria which is applied to every story. Our definition of done is expected to evolve. Currently, it includes the following criteria:

- Acceptance criteria satisfied
- Unit tested
- Manually tested
- Other unit tests still pass
- Code style conforms
- Necessary Octopus Deploy (configuration and process) changes made
- Release notes written
- Formal documentation updated
- Demoed to the team
- PR Approved
