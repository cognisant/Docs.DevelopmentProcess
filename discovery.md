# Discovery

Bath ASU employees can add cards to the Software Development Trello board using a custom form, hosted internally on the Intranet. This form asks users to explain the problem they are facing, what impact this has on the business, and (optionally) what solution they have in mind to solve the problem.

When someone submits information using this form, a card is created in the Inbox list on the Software Development Trello board. The card is automatically formatted using a pre-defined template:

```
# Original Description

Requested by [name] ([email])

> **Title**
>
> [title]
>
> **Description**
>
> [description]
>
> **Solution**
>
> [solution]
>
> **Business Impact**
>
> [business impact]
```

Occasionally, the software development team will manually add cards to Trello at the request of Bath ASU management.
