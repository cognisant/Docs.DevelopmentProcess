# Cognisant Software Development Process

## Introduction

Cognisant develops software for several organisations. Development is done in two-week cycles. Software development cycles get defined and scheduled in Trello boards. These boards are also used to gather and discuss feature requests from users.

## Cycle

Cycles are normally two weeks long. They will start and end with brief review meetings to review the previous cycle and plan the next.

### Example cycle

- Day 1: Review inboxes, plan cycle ahead
- Day 1 & 2: Small features
- Day 3â€“9: Main feature
- Day 10: Documentation, deployment, review

## Trello usage

### Boards

Every organisation has a *Software Development* board. This is used to gather feedback from the organisation and the development team. Discussion about features happens here. There are four lists in each board:

- *Inbox* is used to gather feedback.
- *Under Consideration* contains potential work activities.
- *Agreed* contains work activities that are finalised and can be scheduled.
- *Done* contains completed work activities.

The Cognisant organisation also has an *Active Software Development* board, which is used to manage the current cycle. This includes five lists:

- *Current Cycle*
- *In Development*
- *For Validation*
- *Ready for Deployment*
- *Deployed*

At the start of a cycle, cards which are going to be actioned are copied from the organisation boards into the *Current Cycle* list.

At the end of a cycle, the *Deployed* list is renamed to include the current date and archived. A new empty list is created to replace it.

### Labels

The following label names apply to all main organisation boards. These labels are:

- *[Contractor name]* (pink) for [Contractor name] activities.
- *In Development* (purple) for work activities in the current cycle.
- *Next (Unscheduled)* (green) for work activities to be done next.
- *Small Feature* (yellow) for small features that can be done in less than a day.
- *Someday* (black) for work activities with no short-term due date.

The *Active Software Development* board only uses the *Small Feature* label.

## Distractions

Distractions (things that use up time that are not related to the current cycle activity) should be recorded in a visible place. Monitoring of these distractions can identify regular offenders and end them.
