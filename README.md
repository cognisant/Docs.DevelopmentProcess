# Cognisant Software Development Process

Cognisant develops software products for several companies. It uses the [Scrum](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)>) framework, with development work arranged in two-week [sprints](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)#Sprint>). Together, Cognisant and its customers define what development work goes into each sprint. This guide describes how that process works.

## Process

### Discovery

Users can add cards to the **Software Development** Trello board using a web form, hosted internally on the Intranet. This form asks users to provide:

- A title
- A description
- A proposed solution (optional)
- The impact on the business

When a user submits information using this form, a card is created in the **Inbox** list on the **Software Development** Trello board containing all the information they provided, along with their name and email address.

The team may also manually add cards to Trello at the request of management. When this happens, cards should follow the same format as above.

### Triage

From time to time, the team will go through all the cards in the **Inbox** list on the **Software Development** Trello board, and determine whether or not the idea adds value.

If it does, it gets moved to the **Idea Backlog** list. Otherwise, a comment is left on the card explaining the decision, and the card is archived.

The team may need to consult the user to determine whether the idea adds value. Any discussion or clarifications should added to the Trello card for future reference.

### Prioritisation

#### Writing Stories

#### UI Mockups

#### Business Review

#### Definition of Ready

### Estimating Effort

### Sprints

#### Sprint Kick-off

On the first Monday of a sprint at 10am the sprint begins with a kick-off meeting.
During this meeting the team engages in the following activities to prepare for the sprint:

- For any stories partially complete at the end of the previous sprint, the remaining work should be discussed and estimated.
- A number of additional stories should be selected, which the team will aim to complete during the new sprint. The number of story points chosen is slightly higher (+3) than the number achieved in the previous sprint.
- Each new story is discussed and broken down into a set of fine-grained technical tasks. These tasks are transcribed onto Post-it notes and attached to the sprint board to allow us to track work during the sprint. Occasionally during this breakdown, we will discover some complexity in implementing the feature which had not previously been considered. If this happens, we may choose to re-estimate the story.

#### Daily Scrums

#### Definition of Done

#### Demos

On the last day of a sprint, the team meets with relevant members of the business to present them the work the team completed during the sprint.

The demo is an opportunity for the business to provide feedback on the work. 
Often, any small problems the business points out can be corrected before the end of the day.

This meeting is also a chance for the team to explain how the completed work applies to the business' short term goals.

There is usually a discussion about when the work might be deployed to production and become accessible to users.
