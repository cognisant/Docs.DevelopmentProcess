# Cognisant Software Development Process

## Introduction

Cognisant develops software products for several companies. It uses the [Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)) framework, with development work arranged in two-week [sprints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)#Sprint). Together, Cognisant and its customers define what development work goes into each sprint. This guide describes how that process works.
