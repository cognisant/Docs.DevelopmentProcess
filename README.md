# Cognisant Software Development Process

Cognisant develops software products for several companies. It uses the [Scrum](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)>) framework, with development work arranged in two-week [sprints](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)#Sprint>). Together, Cognisant and its customers define what development work goes into each sprint. This guide describes how that process works.

## Process

### Discovery

Users can add cards to the **Software Development** Trello board using a web form, hosted internally on the Intranet. This form asks users to provide:

- A title
- A description
- A proposed solution (optional)
- The impact on the business

When a user submits information using this form, a card is created in the **Inbox** list on the **Software Development** Trello board containing all the information they provided, along with their name and email address.

The team may also manually add cards to Trello at the request of management. When this happens, cards should follow the same format as above.

### Triage

From time to time, the team will go through all the cards in the **Inbox** list on the **Software Development** Trello board, and determine whether or not the idea adds value.

If it does, it gets moved to the **Idea Backlog** list. Otherwise, a comment is left on the card explaining the decision, and the card is archived.

The team may need to consult the user to determine whether the idea adds value. Any discussion or clarifications should added to the Trello card for future reference.

### Prioritisation

### Research

#### Writing Stories

#### UI Mockups

#### Business Review

#### Definition of Ready

### Estimating Effort

### Sprints

#### Sprint Kick-off

#### Selecting Stories

#### Generating Tasks

#### Daily Scrums

#### Definition of Done

#### Demos

On the last day of a sprint, the team meets with relevant members of the business to present them the work the team completed during the sprint.

The demo is an opportunity for the business to provide feedback on the work. 
Often, any small problems the business points out can be corrected before the end of the day.

This meeting is also a chance for the team to explain how the completed work applies to the business' short term goals.

There is usually a discussion about when the work might be deployed to production and become accessible to users.

#### Retrospective

On the last day of a sprint, after the demo, the team has a retrospective meeting.

There are snacks at this meeting.

During the retrospective, the team discusses how the sprint went, reflecting on what went well during the sprint, any issues that came up, and how productive the sprint was.

The main objective of these meetings is to identify improvements that could be made to the development process.

During the sprint, the team uses the Retrospective Trello board to record any points they think should be discussed at the retrospective.
At the meeting, the team will review all of the discussion points added to the board. 
If necessary, the team will attempt to think of a systematic method of addressing the point raised.
Often discussion points are simply something to keep in mind during future sprints, or a small problem that can be immediately addressed with a simple action.

Any possible process improvements agreed upon by the team will be trialled in a future sprint, then discussed and refined during that sprint's retrospective.

An example of a process improvement derived from a retrospective meeting is [the work in progress limit]().
