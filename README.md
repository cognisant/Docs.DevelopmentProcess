# Cognisant Software Development Process

Cognisant develops software products for several companies. It uses the [Scrum](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)>) framework, with development work arranged in two-week [sprints](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)#Sprint>). Together, Cognisant and its customers define what development work goes into each sprint. This guide describes how that process works.

## Process

### Discovery

Users can add cards to the **Software Development** Trello board using a web form, hosted internally on the Intranet. This form asks users to provide:

- A title
- A description
- A proposed solution (optional)
- The impact on the business

When a user submits information using this form, a card is created in the **Inbox** list on the **Software Development** Trello board containing all the information they provided, along with their name and email address.

The team may also manually add cards to Trello at the request of management. When this happens, cards should follow the same format as above.

### Triage

From time to time, the team will go through all the cards in the **Inbox** list on the **Software Development** Trello board, and determine whether or not the idea adds value.

If it does, it gets moved to the **Idea Backlog** list. Otherwise, a comment is left on the card explaining the decision, and the card is archived.

The team may need to consult the user to determine whether the idea adds value. Any discussion or clarifications should added to the Trello card for future reference.

#### Daily Scrums

 On each day of a sprint at 1:30pm the team holds a daily meeting called the “daily scrum”. For these meetings we gather around the sprint board. Everyone who is able should stand for this meeting, which helps to encourage brevity.
 The daily scrum meeting is not used as a problem-solving or issue resolution meeting. Issues that are raised are taken offline and usually dealt with immediately after the meeting. During the daily scrum, each team member answers the following three questions:

- What did you do since the last meeting?
- What will you do before the next meeting?
- Are there any impediments in your way?

If any impediments are identified, we should aim to resolve them as soon as possible. For issues which cannot be resolved immediately, one team member should take responsibility for following up and ensuring that it is ultimately resolved.

#### Definition of Done

#### Demos

On the last day of a sprint, the team meets with relevant members of the business to present them the work the team completed during the sprint.

The demo is an opportunity for the business to provide feedback on the work. 
Often, any small problems the business points out can be corrected before the end of the day.

This meeting is also a chance for the team to explain how the completed work applies to the business' short term goals.

There is usually a discussion about when the work might be deployed to production and become accessible to users.
