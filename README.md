# Cognisant Software Development Process

Cognisant develops software products for several companies. It uses the [Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)) framework, with development work arranged in two-week [sprints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)#Sprint). Together, Cognisant and its customers define what development work goes into each sprint. This guide describes how that process works.



## Process

### Discovery

Users can add cards to the **Software Development** Trello board using a web form, hosted internally on the Intranet. This form asks users to provide:

- A title
- A description
- A proposed solution (optional)
- The impact on the business

When a user submits information using this form, a card is created in the **Inbox** list on the **Software Development** Trello board containing all the information they provided, along with their name and email address.

The team may also manually add cards to Trello at the request of management. When this happens, cards should follow the same format as above.

### Triage

From time to time, the team will go through all the cards in the **Inbox** list on the **Software Development** Trello board, and determine whether or not the idea adds value.

If it does, it gets moved to the **Idea Backlog** list. Otherwise, a comment is left on the card explaining the decision, and the card is archived.

The team may need to consult the user to determine whether the idea adds value. Any discussion or clarifications should added to the Trello card for future reference.
