# Cognisant Software Development Process

Cognisant develops software products for several companies. It uses the [Scrum](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)>) framework, with development work arranged in two-week [sprints](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)#Sprint>). Together, Cognisant and its customers define what development work goes into each sprint. This guide describes how that process works.

## Process

### Discovery

Users can add cards to the **Software Development** Trello board using a web form, hosted internally on the Intranet. This form asks users to provide:

- A title
- A description
- A proposed solution (optional)
- The impact on the business

When a user submits information using this form, a card is created in the **Inbox** list on the **Software Development** Trello board containing all the information they provided, along with their name and email address.

The team may also manually add cards to Trello at the request of management. When this happens, cards should follow the same format as above.

### Triage

From time to time, the team will go through all the cards in the **Inbox** list on the **Software Development** Trello board, and determine whether or not the idea adds value.

If it does, it gets moved to the **Idea Backlog** list. Otherwise, a comment is left on the card explaining the decision, and the card is archived.

The team may need to consult the user to determine whether the idea adds value. Any discussion or clarifications should added to the Trello card for future reference.

### Prioritisation

The business intermittently advises the team on their current short-term and long-term goals.

At the start of a sprint, the team tries to pick stories relating to the business' current priorities to include in the sprint, rather than work which is a lower priority.

Priorities are also important to keep in mind during **backlog refinement** meetings.  
It is more important for the team to specify and estimate stories relating to the business' urgent priorities, instead of reviewing more general feature requests.

Looking at **epics** labels on Trello cards is an easy way of identifying high-priority stories.  
If an epic is a business priority, then all of the stories belonging to that epic are a priority.

### Research

#### Writing Stories

#### Epics

Several separate stories may relate to a single business objective.

Relatively large business goals which include the completion of several stories, are referred to as 'epics'.

All of the stories which belong to an epic will be labelled (on their Trello card) with the name of the relevant epic.

On the **Software Development** Trello board, there is a 'Current Epics' column containing cards describing the epics which some of the stories on the board currently belong to.

#### UI Mockups

#### Business Review

#### Definition of Ready

### Estimating Effort

### Sprints

#### Sprint Kick-off

#### Selecting Stories

#### Generating Tasks

#### Daily Scrums

#### Definition of Done

#### Demos

On the last day of a sprint, the team meets with relevant members of the business to present them the work the team completed during the sprint.

The demo is an opportunity for the business to provide feedback on the work. 
Often, any small problems the business points out can be corrected before the end of the day.

This meeting is also a chance for the team to explain how the completed work applies to the business' short term goals.

There is usually a discussion about when the work might be deployed to production and become accessible to users.
