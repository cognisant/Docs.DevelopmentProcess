### Prioritisation

The business intermittently advises the team on their current short-term and long-term goals.

At the start of a sprint, the team tries to pick stories relating to the business’ current priorities to include in the sprint.

Priorities are also essential to keep in mind during **backlog refinement** meetings.

It is more important for the team to specify and estimate stories relating to the business’ urgent priorities than reviewing more general feature requests.
