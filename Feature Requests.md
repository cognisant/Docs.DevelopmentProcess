## Feature Requests

Our primary means of gathering requirements is the [Feature request form](https://github.com/cognisant/trello-form). This is accessed via a web browser at a url unique to each Cognisant customer. It invites users to provide:

- A description of a problem
* The business impact of their problem, to be used for prioritization
* [Optionally] A suggested solution to that problem

Completing this form will automatically create a card on Trello containing these details. The use of a structured form ensures that the requests we receive have been given an appropriate amount of thought and are in a consistent format.
